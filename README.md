Hello ANDigital, this is the finished test, I've managed to develope with the queries that the FourSquare App had, and I managed to plug in also some UI features like a simple bootstrap framework so that the client gets basic feedback.

Since it is a DEMO, it shouldn't require much design, but at least a few details should be needed so that we look good in front of them.

I used the default google maps markers for now, but we know that those can be changed anytime.

I home you like this DEMO.

Cheers

Daniel Arias
